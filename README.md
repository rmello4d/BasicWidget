## Custom Widget for [Wakanda](http://wakanda.org)
The __BasicWidget__ widget allows you to create a simple widget in the Wakanda framework

### Properties
This widget has the following properties: 

* __width__: The width of the widget
* __height__: The height of your widget

### Goals
The __BasicWidget__ shows how simple is to create a empty widget on Wakanda. 

By default, a < DIV > will be created. 

In this example we are creating a widget with a < SPAN > tag instead. 


### CSS
The __BasicWidget__ will be displayed first in green. You can adjust its color by changing directly in the Studio OR by changing the /css/widget.css file.
